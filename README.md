# AdventuraVerse<br>

1. Introduction<br>

The project "AdventuraVerse" is a multi-level game designed to entertain and engage players in various challenges. It comprises three levels, each offering a distinct game: Rock Paper Scissors, Riddles, and Connect 4. The project utilizes Python programming language to implement game logic and user interaction.<br>

2. Project Components<br>

The project consists of the following components:<br>

Game Logic Modules: The game logic is implemented through Python functions and classes to handle player choices, determine winners, manage scores, generate riddles, and control Connect 4 gameplay.<br>

User Interaction: The game interacts with users through console input and output. Players are prompted to make choices, solve riddles, and place discs in the Connect 4 grid.<br>

3. Game Flow<br>

The game progresses through three distinct levels:<br>

Level 1: Rock Paper Scissors - Players engage in the classic game of Rock Paper Scissors. The winner is determined based on predefined rules. Each correct guess earns a player one point.<br>

Level 2: Riddles - Players are presented with riddles and must provide correct answers. Each correct answer earns a point. Riddles are randomly selected from a predefined set.<br>

Level 3: Connect 4 - Players strategically place discs in a grid to form a sequence of four discs either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. The first player to achieve this wins the game.<br>

4. Code Overview<br>

The Python code consists of functions and classes for game logic, user input handling, and score management.
Functions such as get_player_choice, determine_winner, get_riddle, init_board, print_board, and check_win facilitate game mechanics and flow.
The Stack class is used to manage the placement of discs in the Connect 4 grid.
The main function orchestrates the entire game flow, handling user input, displaying game elements, and updating scores.<br>

5. Conclusion<br>

The "AdventuraVerse" project offers an engaging gaming experience with multiple levels of challenges. It combines traditional games with puzzles and strategic gameplay to entertain players. The project demonstrates the use of Python programming for game development and user interaction.<br>

Further enhancements could include graphical user interface (GUI) implementation, additional levels with diverse challenges, and integration of multiplayer functionalities for enhanced gaming experiences.<br>
